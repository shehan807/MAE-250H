Next possible tasks include:
1) Performance optimization of Python/Cython Code: 
Some underlying bottleneck still is preventing 
feasible computational time -- before simulating 
anymore literature cases or higher Re, code MUST be optimized 
2) Completing Validation for all Ghia cases at steady state 
3) POD -- simulate Re 100 to 1000 at intervals of 100 and 
attempt to replicate some arbitrary Re
